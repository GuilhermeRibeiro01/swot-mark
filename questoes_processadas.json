Below is a sample of the data available to the data scientist.<br/><img class=\"in-exam-image\" src=\"https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04145/0007800001.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;;height:auto\"/><br/>How should the data scientist split the dataset into a training and test set for this use case?<br/>\n</p>",
